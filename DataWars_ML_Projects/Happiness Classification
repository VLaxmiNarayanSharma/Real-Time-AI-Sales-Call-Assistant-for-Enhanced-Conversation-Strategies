Model
Let's separate the target and the features into two variables.

1
Separate the target and the features into two variables.

Store the features in X and the target in y. Both variables should be dataframes and keep the headers.

Despite there being various ways to solve this exercise, the results must be dataframes in order to be considered correct.

Correct!

Let's split the dataset into train and test sets. The argument test_size is a float value whose value ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, which represents the proportion of our test size. its default value is none. The train_size argument is similar to test_size, but it represents the proportion of our train size.

2
Use train_test_split to split the data into training and testing sets. Split the dataset in 80% training, 20% testing, and random_state=0.

Set the random_state parameter to a desired integer value for reproducibility.

Store the values in the variables in X_train,X_test,y_train and y_test.

Let's use a logistic regression algorithm to predict Happiness.

Logistic Regression is a statistical algorithm used for binary classification problems. It models the relationship between a set of independent variables (features) and a binary dependent variable (target) by estimating the probabilities of the target variable belonging to each class. You will learn and practice in detail about machine learning models in future tracks.

You will need to import :

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

4
Train a LogisticRegression classifier

It's time to train the LogisticRegression using the training dataset.

5
Make predictions on the test set

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data. Store the prediction in y_pred.
