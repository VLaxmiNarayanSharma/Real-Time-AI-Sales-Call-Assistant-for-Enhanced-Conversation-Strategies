EDA
Let's import the dataset icecreamsales.csv and explore it. Store the dataset in df. Check the structure of the data by inspecting the number of rows, columns, and attributes of the dataset. You can use functions like .shape, .head(), .info(), and .describe() to get a quick overview of the data.

Select whether this problem is a regression or a classification problem.


Classification


Regression

Correct!
Start project before checking your activities.

Let's separate the target and the features into two variables.

Model Building
Let's split the dataset into train and test sets. The argument test_size is a float value whose value ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, which represents the proportion of our test size. its default value is none. The train_size argument is similar to test_size, but it represents the proportion of our train size.

3
Use train_test_split to split the data into training and testing sets. Split the dataset in 80% training, 20% testing, and random_state=0.

Set the random_state parameter to a desired integer value for reproducibility. Store this variable in random_state and then use it in the function.

Store the values in the variables in X_train,X_test,y_train and y_test.

To implement linear regression in Python, you will need to import the following module:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
