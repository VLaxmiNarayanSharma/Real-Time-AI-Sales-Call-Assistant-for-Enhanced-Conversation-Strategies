Scenario Question

You are a data scientist working on a binary classification problem. You have tried two different models for the task. Model A uses a simple hypothesis space with a linear model, while Model B employs a more complex hypothesis space with a high-degree polynomial. After evaluating both models, you notice that Model B fits the training data almost perfectly, but its performance on new, unseen data is not as good. On the other hand, Model A generalizes better to unseen data.

Based on this scenario, which model is likely suffering from overfitting?


Model A, because it uses a linear hypothesis space.


Neither model is suffering from overfitting.


Both models are suffering from overfitting.


Model B, because it fits the training data almost perfectly.
