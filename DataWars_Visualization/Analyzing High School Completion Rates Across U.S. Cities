Analyzing High School Completion Rates Across U.S. Cities
To practice data visualization skills by generating bar plots and pie charts using Python, focusing on the proportion of people over 25 who have completed high school in various U.S. cities.

Dataset Description:

The dataset contains information about the percentage of people over 25 who have completed high school in different cities across various geographic areas in the United States.

Data Exploration and Cleaning
Use Python and Pandas library to load the dataset into a dataframe. Then display the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview of the data.

Check for missing values and the data types of each column to ensure they are appropriate.

1
Construct a Bar Plot for State-Wise Comparison

Calculate the average high school completion rate for each state and visualize these averages using a bar plot. This will help in comparing the education level across different states.

Your task:

Use the code from in notebook to find average high school completion rate for each state, defined in the variable state_averages.

Create a bar plot to compare these averages across states.

Instructions:

Define the figure and axes using fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 7)).
Set appropriate labels and title:

ax1.set_xlabel('State')
ax1.set_ylabel('Average Completion Rate (%)')
ax1.set_title('Average High School Completion Rate by State')
Choose the skyblue color palette that is visually appealing.
Define the title as : Average High School Completion Rate by State
Your bar plot should look similar to the sample image provided. imageDescription

Create a Pie Chart of Top 5 Cities with Highest High School Completion Rate

Identify the top 5 cities with the highest high school completion rates from the dataset and to create a pie chart that effectively visualizes the proportion of high school completion rates in these cities.

Your task:

Use the top_cities which contains sorted dataset based on the 'percent_completed_hs' column to find the top 5 cities with the highest high school completion rates.
Create a bar plot to compare these averages across states.
Instructions:

Define the figure and axes using fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8)).
Ensure that the pie chart includes labels for each city, along with the percentage of the total that each city represents.
Choose a distinct color scheme to clearly differentiate each city. Use: ['gold', 'yellowgreen', 'lightcoral', 'lightskyblue', 'lavender'] .
Define the title as: Top 5 Cities with Highest High School Completion Rates
Your pie chart should look similar to the image below.

Pie Chart - Category Comparison in Oak Grove town

Focus on a specific city that exhibits a diverse range of high school completion rates, categorize these rates into defined groups, and create a pie chart to visually represent these categories. This will help in understanding the distribution of education levels within a selected city.

Your task:

Select Oak Grove town city and Categorize Completion Rates:

Choose Oak Grove town from the dataset that shows a varied distribution of high school completion rates.
Categorize the completion rates into distinct groups (e.g., below 50%, 50-75%, above 75%).
Count the number of occurrences in each category.
Your pie chart should look similar to the sample image provided.
