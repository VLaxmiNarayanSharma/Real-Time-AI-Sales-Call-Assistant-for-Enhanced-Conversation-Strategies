Activities
This project aims to help you understand when to use scatter plots and line plots appropriately, and more importantly, when these types of plots may result in misinterpreting data. You will participate in hands-on activities utilizing Matplotlib in Python to grasp the intricacies of these visualization techniques.

Activities
1
Scatter Plots with Non-Numerical Data

Create a scatter plot for given dummy categorical data in the notebook. Remember, categorical data represents groups/categories (like types, names, or labels) and is not numerical in nature. Scatter plot will have categorical data on the x-axis and the corresponding numerical values on the y-axis.

Your plot looks like below:


Preview
Correct!
2
Does the scatter plot effectively communicate any meaningful relationship or pattern?

In our last exercise, you crafted a scatter plot using categorical data. Reflect on how well this plot showcases a meaningful relationship or pattern.

Does the scatter plot successfully reveal any significant patterns or relationships from the previous activity?


No


Yes

Correct!
3
Line Plots for Unordered Categories

Create a line plot for given dummy unordered categorical data in the notebook. Line plot will have categorical data on the x-axis and the corresponding numerical values on the y-axis.

Line plots are typically used to show trends and changes over a continuous range, such as time. When applied to categorical data that has no inherent order, line plots can create misleading impressions of trends or relationships.

Your plot looks like below:


Preview
Correct!
# Creating a line plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(df['Category'],df['Value'])
ax.set_xlabel('Category')
ax.set_ylabel('Value')
ax.set_title('Line Plot with Unordered Categorical Data')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Which of the following statements best reflects the suitability of using a scatter plot for time series data?

You have been given a dummy data containing time series data, which includes dates and corresponding temperature readings over several months. Create a scatter plot to visualize this data. After examining the plot, consider the effectiveness of a scatter plot in this context.

# Sample time series data
dates = pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', periods=5, freq='D')
data = {'Date': dates, 'Value': [10, 15, 14, 17, 16]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

Scatter plots fail to convey the continuity and sequence inherent in time series data, making them less ideal compared to line plots.


The suitability of scatter plots for time series data depends entirely on the range of data and has nothing to do with the data type.


Scatter plots are suitable for time series data only if the data points are not in a sequential order..


Scatter plots are ideal for time series data as they accurately represent the sequence and continuity inherent in the data.

Correct!
