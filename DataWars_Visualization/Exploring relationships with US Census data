Activities
In this project, we'll start practicing how to create relationship plots, including point/line plots and scatter plots.

To do so, we'll use The Washington Post's extensive database of fatal shootings by U.S. police officers, as well as from accompanying U.S. census datasets.

The dataset we'll use is named hs_rate_poverty.csv and it contains a normalized measure of poverty and high school graduation per US state.

We'll use point/line plots and scatter plots to analyze these relationships.

Activities
1
Plotting and Comparing Socio-Economic Indicators with Matplotlib

Create a visualization featuring two-point plots on the same graph.

The first one represents normalized poverty rates, using df['normalized_poverty_rate'] and using a red marker (that is already provided).

The second one representing normalized high school graduation rates, using df['normalized_hs_rate'], and using a blue x marker (already provided).

This visualization will enable a comparative analysis of these two crucial socio-economic indicators across different states using Matplotlib.

Your visualization should have a size of (14, 7) and look something like:

Note: We are helping you with the markers, colors, and titles.

Correct!
2
Scatter Plotting Socio-Economic Indicators

Create a scatter plot to visualize and analyze the relationship between the two key socio-economic indicators: the normalized high school graduation rate (normalized_hs_rate) and the poverty rate (normalized_poverty_rate) across different U.S. states.

Use normalized_hs_rate in the X axis and normalized_poverty_rate in the Y axis. Your plot should look something like this:

Correct!
