Understanding the Dataset
Column Overview:

Unnamed: 0: This is an index column.

id: A unique identifier for each Nobel Prize. Multiple rows can share the same id if a prize is awarded to more than one laureate.

firstname and surname: The names of the laureates.

born and died: Dates of birth and death.

bornCountry, bornCountryCode, bornCity: Information about the birthplace.

diedCountry, diedCountryCode, diedCity: Information about the place of death.

gender: The gender of the laureate.

year: The year the Nobel Prize was awarded.

category: The category of the Nobel Prize (e.g., economics, chemistry).

share: Indicates how many laureates share the prize (e.g., 2.0 means two laureates shared the prize).

motivation: The reasoning behind the award.

name: The institution or affiliation of the laureate at the time of the award.

city and country: The location of the institution or affiliation.

Why Some Names Appear Twice:
Shared Prizes: When a Nobel Prize is awarded to multiple laureates, the same id will appear in multiple rows for each laureate who shares the prize. This means that the laureates’ names will be the same, but the name, city, and country columns may differ based on their affiliations. Example: In the case of Elinor Ostrom, she shares the Nobel Prize with another laureate, which results in two rows for the same award year. The differences in the name, city, and country columns indicate her affiliation with different institutions.

Use a Multi-line Plot to Show Nobel Prizes Won by Countries over the Decades.

In this activity, your task is to create a visualization of how the number of Nobel Prizes won by various countries has changed over the decades.

Task Instructions:

Use a for loop to iterate over the DataFrame laureates_by_decade_country, which has already been calculated.

Plot each country as a separate line on the chart.

Parameters for the plot should be: - Figure size: 10 by 6

Country as label

Marker: o

Title: "Nobel Prizes Won by Country Over the Decades"
